This module adds links to taxonomy terms to the global navigation menu.
The new integrated administration menu in Drupal 4.3 allows modules to add
their own links to the global heirarchical menu, and this module takes
advantage of this in order to display a taxonomy navigation menu in a
style consistent with the rest of the Drupal site navigation.
