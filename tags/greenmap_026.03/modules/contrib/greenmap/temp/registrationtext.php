<p>We welcome your participation in this vibrant global movement. We hope that 
  you have reviewed some of the profiles in the Maps section, and read through 
  the Introduction and FAQ in this section. </p>
<p>Now, Get Ready! Here are the Five Steps</p>
<p>Step 1: Check if a Green Map project is already underway in your area (Check 
  the List). If it's active, contact the Mapmaker and see if you can get involved. 
  If there are no existing Green Map projects or if your specific project scale 
  is different, you can begin the registration process.</p>
<p>Step 2: Read over the <?php print l(t('Terms and Conditions'),'participate/mapmakeragreementplain'); ?> (link opens in new window). </p>
<p>Step 3 (optional): Download the offline registration documents. To register 
  as a Green Mapmaker requires a lot of information. If you wish to discuss the 
  information with your project partners you can download the documents and complete 
  them offline. Then come back to the website and continue the registration process.</p>
