DESCRIPTION:

The E-Commerce donate module allows you to receive money for
specified charities, activities and causes. Each "donate" product
that you create will have a name like: "Kids for Squids". When your
website visitor chooses to donate, they enter how much they would
like to donate, and that amount is added to their shopping cart.
