DESCRIPTION:

This package aims to provide a framework for a complete ecommerce
solution for your website.

Product modules are available that allow you to sell a variety of product
types, from physical "tangible" products to virtual "files" or
perhaps "parcels" containing multiple items.

Shipping has changed in 4.7 with a new shipping api paving the
way for many more shipping plug-ins than have been available.
There is currently ongoing support for UPS/Fedex shipping via the
shipcalc module.

Payment modules cover many popular payment gateways and in addition
you can opt for "COD" which allows alternative forms of
payment.

A transaction system allows you to track and manage your orders,
changing the status as necessary and sending invoices and shipping
notifications.


********************************************************************
INSTALLATION:

Note: It is assumed that you have Drupal up and running. If you are
having problems, please review the Handbook, especially
http://drupal.org/node/43767. Besides Drupal core and ecommerce itself,
token.module (http://drupal.org/project/token) is also required to be installed 
and active.

Preparing for Installation:
---------------------------
Note: Please back up your site and database.

1. Place the entire ecommerce directory into your Drupal /modules/
   directory. Alternatively, it can be placed in
   /sites/default/modules which effectively separates it from Drupal
   core modules.

2. As of 4.7, you do *not* need to install the database tables
   manually.

3. Enable your choice of modules by going to:
   > administer > modules.

   Because E-Commerce contains a large number of modules, the module
   installation screen can be confusing. Look at the end of this file
   for a summary of the ecommerce entries you'll find there,
   including a list of required ones.

4. For the final configuration of the modules, navigate to a menu
   location which is new for 4.7:
   > administer > store > settings

   Click on the module name in the navagation tree to
   configure module-specific options.

6. Grant the proper access to user accounts under:
   > administer > access control

7. Create new products via create
   > create content > product

8. Optionally, enable the cart block via
   > administer > blocks :: Shopping Cart
